🗺️ U.S. States Game

This is a U.S. States guessing game built using Python's Turtle graphics and Pandas. The objective is to guess all 50 U.S. states and place them correctly on a map.

How it works:
The game displays a blank map of the United States.
A prompt asks you to type the name of a U.S. state.
If the guess is correct, the state name appears on the map at its correct location.
The game continues until all 50 states are correctly guessed, or you can type "Exit" to quit.

Features:
Keeps track of correctly guessed states.
On exit, generates a CSV file (states_to_learn.csv) containing the states you missed, so you can practice later!

Tech stack:
Turtle for graphics and interactive UI.
Pandas for handling CSV data and saving missed states.

Feel free to clone the project and try it out! Test your knowledge of U.S. geography while having fun! 🌍🎮
